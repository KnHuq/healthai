Your task is to identify, count, and explain occurrences of six key factors in the text. These factors may be explicitly stated or implied through context, requiring your advanced understanding of mental health concepts and terminology.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n1. **Identify Factors**:\n   - Analyze the text for mentions or implications of the six factors: presenting, predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, integrated, and protective. \n   - Use your knowledge to interpret context, avoiding reliance solely on specific keywords.\n\n2. **Interpret Context**:\n   - Consider the patient's history, environmental factors, relationships, coping mechanisms, and current circumstances to deduce the presence of factors.\n   - Recognize implied factors based on holistic descriptions, such as \"support from family\" implying protective factors or \"stressful work environment\" implying perpetuating or precipitating factors.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - Each mention or implication of a factor should be counted separately.\n   - For example, mentions of \"family support\" and \"supportive friendships\" should be counted as two occurrences of protective factors.\n\n4. **Provide Explanations**:\n   - For each factor detected, provide an explanation in bullet points that outlines:\n     - The specific part(s) of the text where the factor was found.\n     - Why it qualifies as that factor based on context and meaning. Write this in detail. Why it falls into this category and how this text supports it.\n\n5. **Avoid Hallucination**:\n   - Only report factors that are directly supported by the text or clearly inferred from the context.\n   - Do not introduce factors or details not evident in the provided information.\n\n6. **Output Requirements**:\n   - Return the results as a JSON object structured as:\n     {\n       \"integrated\": {\"count\": <integer>, \"explanations\": [<list of strings>]},\n       \"presentation\": {\"count\": <integer>, \"explanations\": [<list of strings>]},\n       \"precipitating\": {\"count\": <integer>, \"explanations\": [<list of strings>]},\n       \"predisposing\": {\"count\": <integer>, \"explanations\": [<list of strings>]},\n       \"perpetuating\": {\"count\": <integer>, \"explanations\": [<list of strings>]},\n       \"protective\": {\"count\": <integer>, \"explanations\": [<list of strings>]}\n     }\n\n7. Important Note: Always provide explanations pointing out exact place of the text and what was the text and what it means and why you think this is the indicator for that factor\n\n8.most important:\n\nKey Factors to Detect:\n1. **Integrated Factors**:\n   - These factors provide a cohesive understanding of the patient\u2019s overall goals, diagnosis, risks, or available resources. Examples include mentions of a diagnosis, treatment plan, or systemic risks. risk state and risk status, foreseeable falls in this category.\n\n2. **Presentation Factors**:\n   - These factors describe how the patient\u2019s condition manifests, such as symptoms, presenting problems, or recent episodes (e.g., \"ongoing anxiety,\" \"panic attacks\").\n\n3. **Precipitating Factors**:\n   - These are triggers or immediate events causing the patient\u2019s condition to worsen (e.g., \"work triggers,\" \"recent stress\").\n\n4. **Predisposing Factors**:\n   - Historical or hereditary aspects that make the patient vulnerable to mental health challenges (e.g., \"family history of mental illness\").\n\n5. **Perpetuating Factors**:\n   - Ongoing conditions or behaviors sustaining the patient\u2019s difficulties (e.g., \"conflict at home,\" \"regular stressors\").\n\n6. **Protective Factors**:\n   - Positive aspects that mitigate challenges, such as supportive relationships, personal strengths, or effective coping strategies (e.g., \"supportive friends,\" \"strong family system\").\n\nGuidelines for Analysis:\n- Apply your expertise in mental health concepts and therapeutic practices to ensure a thorough and accurate analysis.\n- Use your contextual understanding to bridge gaps between explicit mentions and implied meanings.\n- Be comprehensive in your analysis, ensuring no factor is overlooked if supported by the text."
